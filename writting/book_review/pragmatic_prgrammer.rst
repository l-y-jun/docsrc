Preface
-------

Pragmatics refers from latin *pragmaticus(skillful of work),*  
and that reference came from greek which means that of *doing ... a thing.*

Programming is *Craft.* 
Programmer is someone who

   - listens,
   - advices,
   - traslates,
   - orders,
   - understand ambigous things and find better expressions to describe them,
   - writes document for their work make easy to understand,
   - architects own work to be used by others,

and try hard to make theses whole work in time.
Programmer does make little miracles per day by day. that's such a hard job.

But we have helpers like,

   1. tool from vernders saying their tool guarantee good state,
   #. master of some development method who are saying their's also good,
   #. Everyone saying their programming languages which is best,
   #. Lot of OS saying they cure whole problems.

Above all of them, nothing is Right.
There is only specific Environment-set and **each set of environment have each proper systems.**::

   This is what pragmaticism means.

   Should not rely on specific Technology.
   And We need enough background informations and experiences to make specific situation better.
   Intelligence based on Good base comes from understanding the computer science's basic princeples,
   Experience comes from projects of many different subjects.
   combination of Theroy and implementation will grom us stronger.

How to be Practical one
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Every process, Every day, **Do Think and be make Every decisions with Critical Thinking.**
**Do Design only based on Engineering rules and your analysis.**
**Do a Kaizen, which means doing of make improve constantly by little by little.***
**Build a small wall with reminding the Whole castle, which oneday will be built.**
**Be Professional, Take responsible for your career and saying.**

I am reading this book just after read *The software craftsman.*
I learned and experienced about being craftsman and professional from them.

in loose saying, This is kind of old bible of being a developer.

The book is about not only spritual and communicational social way to be better one,
but also how to act and think properly in practice with describing how product can be better.
How the software should be, and how can i satisfy the minimum requirements for that.

In mid of reading this book, i felt what i was doing was not programming compared to their saying.
I guess i did things to be work for little tries and i was bit satisfied with my head full of manuals only.
It yet hard to say what is better programming work or act, and how should we do as.
But it helped me doing something better at least.


After Read
----------
I Feel not statisfied with my self.
it could be from lack of nice testing.
it could be from lack of project branching stratgy.
it could be from lack of automations.
I think aboves are all right. but at the end of all that practicals, there is only one.
*"I Do not feel what i did something better."*

i turely liked Albert Einstein's line refered in book,
*"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."*
I guess i did old routines to follow the unix heros without any meaning.
writing makefile, writing README, programming in c.
that is nice idea. and i'm in admiring for them, and to be like them.
but that acts at each moment was actually meaning less.
that was like saying "i'm using classic so it will be fine.".
but i found that was critical mistake.

Even if pragmaticism and craftsmanship is made of 50% of Professionalism.
another half or more is just acknowlege the needs to be better, and make me move toward to start change myself.

Need in improvement, change in acknowledgement, after that, my effort.
Not best answer but self concisous and regrets, after that, constant act of improving.
Invest myself in better way.

Last line in book was by Winston Churchill,
*Never give up, never give up and never give up.*
